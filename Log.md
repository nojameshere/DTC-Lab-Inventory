# This is the place where I will log what I have done each day. It is pretty much just a more easily readable commit log.

## October 9th
- Project created with Create-react-app
- Started work on the log-in page to be in-line with my project proposal's milestones.
- I need to discuss the creation flow for admin users for this program.
    - Do we want to manually add users or would we like to have a specific registration password users would need to get setup?
- I am going to work on making the user authentication work. I still need to decide how to have the logged-in bool work. Pretty much do I put in an auth context or find some other way with auth tokens.

## October 10th
- Laid the groundwork for authentication through firebase. 
- This auth method requires a .env file and I will eventually add the db config files
to this same .env file. If you need this file please see George Ray.
- Moved all non-main css files into a new css folder for cleanliness.
